Keys pressed: ```<4><3><j><e><x><i><2><esc><shift><;><w><q><enter>``` Use ```43j``` to navigate to the 43rd line and then use ```e``` to get to the end of the word "index1." Then ```x``` deletes 1 and then ```i``` puts vim into insert mode, which allows me to then type 2 to make it "index2." Then exited insert mode by clicking the escape key. Then ```<shift><;>``` gives us the colon and then type wq to save and exit.
